spec-query
==========

This is a small utility to query specs for Ruby on Rails projects.
This is useful if:
* you want to run specs that only contain some keywords
* you have a lot of slow specs and do not have a good organization of them

Install
=======

If you are using bundler, add this to the Gemfile:

gem "spec_query", :require => nil

No need for require, this is used only through a rake task.

You need to install the rake task manually. The easiest way is to find spec_query/lib/tasks/spec_query.rake in your GEM_PATH (run: `gem env` in console) and copy it to your projects lib/tasks.

Copy

Examples
========

# for help
rake q:spec # see help
rake q:spec q="keyword" # run only specs that have a keyword
rake q:spec q='keyword1&&keyword2||keyword3&&keyword4' # || is or, && is and
rake q:spec q='regexp --r' # use regexp
rake q:spec q='Case Sensitive statement --c' use case sensitive
